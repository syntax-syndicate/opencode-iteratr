Task "Iteration Loop - Check session_complete signal" was already completed in a previous iteration. The orchestrator.go:168-172 checks IsSessionComplete() after each iteration, client.go:49-52 exposes the flag, and tools.go:129-136 handles the session_complete tool call and sets the flag. All tests pass.
