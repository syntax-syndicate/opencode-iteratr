## Complete Workflow Validation

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Title Step** ✅
   - User input with validation
   - Transitions to description step

2. **Description Step** ✅
   - Multi-line textarea
   - Length validation (10-500 chars)
   - Ctrl+D submit
   - Transitions to model selection

3. **Model Selection Step** ✅
   - Shows available models
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Transitions to agent phase

4. **Agent Phase** ✅
   - MCP server starts on random port
   - opencode ACP subprocess spawned
   - MCP server URL passed to agent via session/new
   - Agent sends session/prompt with interview instructions
   - Agent calls ask-questions tool repeatedly
   - Questions displayed in TUI with:
     - Single-select and multi-select support
     - "Type your own answer" option auto-appended
     - Tab navigation (options → custom input → buttons)
     - Answer validation and persistence
     - Question counter ("Question X of Y")
     - Back/Next/Submit buttons
   - Agent calls finish-spec tool with generated spec
   - Spec content received and stored
   - Transitions to review step

5. **Review Step** ✅
   - Markdown rendered with syntax highlighting
   - Viewport for scrolling content
   - External editor support (press 'e')
   - Tab navigation to buttons
   - Restart button (with confirmation)
   - Save button
   - Transitions to completion

6. **File Save** ✅
   - Checks if file exists
   - Shows overwrite confirmation if needed
   - Slugifies filename (e.g., "My Feature" → "my-feature.md")
   - Saves to specs/ directory
   - Updates specs/README.md with marker-based insertion
   - Extracts first line of spec for description
   - Truncates description to 100 chars

7. **Completion Step** ✅
   - Shows success message
   - Displays saved file path
   - Start Build button (launches `iteratr build --spec <path>`)
   - Exit button (quits to shell)

### Navigation & Controls

- **ESC Key** ✅
  - Title step: exits wizard
  - Description step: returns to title
  - Model step: returns to description
  - Agent phase (spinner): shows cancel confirmation modal
  - Agent phase (first question): shows cancel confirmation modal
  - Agent phase (subsequent questions): goes back to previous question
  - Review step (viewport): shows cancel confirmation modal
  - Review step (buttons): returns to viewport

- **Ctrl+C** ✅
  - Exits wizard at any step (Bubbletea handles gracefully)

- **Tab Navigation** ✅
  - Question view: cycles through options → custom input → back → next/submit
  - Review step: viewport → buttons
  - Completion step: between Start Build and Exit buttons

- **Back Button** ✅
  - Question view: shows restart confirmation modal
  - Confirmed: returns to agent phase start

- **Validation** ✅
  - Title: non-empty, max 100 chars
  - Description: 10-500 chars
  - Questions: answers required before advancing
  - Multi-select: at least one option selected

### Error Handling

All error conditions properly handled:
- ✅ opencode not installed → error screen with clear message
- ✅ MCP server start failure → error screen
- ✅ ACP initialization failure → error screen
- ✅ Agent early termination → error screen with stop reason
- ✅ File overwrite prompt → confirmation modal
- ✅ Invalid input → inline error messages

### Component Integration

1. **Command Layer** (`cmd/iteratr/spec.go`) ✅
   - Loads config with precedence
   - Validates model requirement
   - Calls specwizard.Run()
   - Returns appropriate exit codes

2. **Wizard Core** (`internal/tui/specwizard/wizard.go`) ✅
   - Manages step state machine
   - Handles all step transitions
   - Coordinates agent lifecycle
   - Cleans up resources on exit

3. **MCP Server** (`internal/specmcp/`) ✅
   - Starts HTTP server on random port
   - Registers ask-questions and finish-spec tools
   - Blocks tool handlers until UI responds
   - Sends questions/content via channels
   - Shuts down cleanly

4. **Agent Runner** (`internal/agent/runner.go`) ✅
   - Spawns opencode ACP subprocess
   - Sends session/new with MCP servers array
   - Sends session/prompt with interview instructions
   - Listens for notifications
   - Detects completion/errors

5. **UI Components** (`internal/tui/specwizard/*_step.go`) ✅
   - All steps implement proper lifecycle (Init, Update, View, SetSize)
   - Consistent styling and layout
   - Proper focus management
   - Reusable patterns (ButtonBar, FocusableComponent)

5. **TAS-5**: Spawn opencode with session/new ✅ (iteration #53 verified)
6. **TAS-6**: Send hardcoded prompt ✅ (iteration #15)
7. **TAS-7**: Verify agent calls finish-spec ✅ (iteration #53 verified)
